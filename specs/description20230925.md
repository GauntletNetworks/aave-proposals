## Summary
Gauntletâ€™s analysis has identified opportunities to adjust interest rate parameters for WETH on v3 markets. This will help to facilitate more Emode borrowing against LST collateral, which may
- drive additional revenue to Aave.
- adjust current risk profile for LST to depend less on onchain liquidity, which has been steadily declining over the past few months. This may be adding risk to the current borrow composition against LST collateral.


## Specification


| Chain | Asset | Action | Current Value | New Value
|-------|-------|-----| ---| --- |

| Optimism | WETH | Lower Variable Slope 1| 3.8%| 3.3%
| Polygon | WETH | Lower Variable Slope 1| 3.8%| 3.3%
| Avalanche | WETH | Lower Variable Slope 1| 3.8%| 3.3%
| Metis | WETH | Lower Variable Slope 1| 3.8%| 3.3%
