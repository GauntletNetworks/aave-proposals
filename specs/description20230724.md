## Summary

Gauntlet recommends parameter changes on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3, Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]((https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/7?u=gauntlet)).


## Motivation

These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntletâ€™s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Ethereum v3, Ethereum v2, and Arbitrum Aave v3 protocols.


## Specification
**Ethereum v3**
| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| DAI Loan To Value | 67% | 77% |
